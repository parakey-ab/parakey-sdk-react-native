# Distribution License Terms for Parakey SDK

These terms govern the use of the Parakey SDK ("the SDK"), provided by Parakey AB (organization number 556975-7296), for integration with Parakey AB’s services.

The Parakey SDK consists of two platform-specific software development kits:

Both SDKs are provided solely for integration with Parakey-enabled systems in mobile applications. These terms apply equally to both SDKs unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Important:  
These terms apply only to companies, legal entities, or organizations.  
Individual consumers are strictly prohibited from accessing, downloading, installing, or using the SDK under any circumstances.

Any disputes shall be resolved in the District Court of Gothenburg (Göteborgs tingsrätt).

Any unauthorized use of the SDK constitutes a violation of these terms and may be subject to legal enforcement by Parakey.

# **10\. Amendments**
